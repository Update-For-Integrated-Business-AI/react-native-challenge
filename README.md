# Disco Engineering

Welcome to the development challenge for the Disco mobile application. This challenge is designed to assess your technical skills, creativity, and ability to translate wireframes into functional React Native components.

## The Challenge

Your task is to develop the "Insights and Budget Screen," which provides users with an overview of their spending habits based on their submitted receipts and offers budgeting insights.

## Provided Materials:

- [Wireframes](./Wireframe%20v3.0%20-%20Budget.jpg) for the Insights and Budget Screen (attached with this challenge).
- [Design guidelines](./Brand%20Colors.png) including color schemes and fonts.

## Tasks:

1. **Develop the UI**: Translate the wireframe into a functional React Native screen. Ensure your implementation is responsive and adheres to the provided design guidelines.
2. **Use Mock Data**: Simulate the screen's functionality using mock data (e.g., displaying spending trends, budget goals).
3. **Ensure Code Quality**: Write clean, well-organized, and commented code. Follow React Native best practices.
4. **Document Your Work**: Provide a brief documentation explaining your code structure, components used, and any libraries or tools you incorporated.

## Optional Enhancements:
Feel free to add creative elements or features, like interactive charts for spending trends, notifications for budget limits, or custom user settings.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Fidelity to wireframes and design guidelines.
- Cleanliness and structure of code.
- Technical proficiency in React Native.
- Creativity and problem-solving skills demonstrated through optional enhancements.
